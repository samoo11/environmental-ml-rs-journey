# Environmental Data Science – Monthly Portfolio

This repository documents my 12‑month journey in environmental data science, focusing on hydrology, remote sensing, and machine learning.  
Each month includes one complete, reproducible project designed to build a strong technical portfolio and demonstrate practical skills.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository
- Build a structured, month‑by‑month portfolio in environmental data science  
- Strengthen skills in Google Earth Engine, Python, and remote sensing  
- Apply machine learning and deep learning to real environmental datasets  
- Create clear, reproducible, and well‑documented projects  
- Develop a public professional presence through consistent GitHub activity

Each project contains:
- `code.js` or `code.py` – main script  
- `README.md` – project documentation  
- `notes.md` – observations and learning notes  
- `outputs/` – exported maps, figures, or results
